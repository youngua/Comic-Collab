            <p class="artist-blurb">Elisha's a big suburb kid in a little city studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. I am set to graduate in 2021 and will be pursuing a career in storyboarding or animation direction. 

            Their art is like a box of chocolates — sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, sometimes it has orange in it, but it is always made to be enjoyed. I love telling stories about absurd worlds and outlandish concepts, but always with central grounding in real, human stories. Nothing is more touching to me than empathy and compassion, and I think animation is the best tool to use to connect with others.
